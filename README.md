# Smart Invoice Spend

This project uses Large Language Models (LLMs) to extract, classify, and analyze invoice line items. The goal is to automate spend categorization and uncover insights using  AI tool stack.

## 💼 Use Case

- Extract invoice line items from PDFs, emails, or text
- Classify line items into spend categories using LLMs (OpenAI, Claude, or open-source)
- Visualize spend distribution, top vendors, and category-level KPIs
- Compare tool performance and cost-effectiveness

## 📊 Stack

- Data Extraction: PyMuPDF / PDFPlumber / Tika / Textract
- Classification: OpenAI GPT-4, Claude, or LLaMA models via API
- Dashboard: Streamlit / Plotly Dash / PowerBI (TBD)
- Storage: Pandas / SQLite / CSV

## 🧠 Planned Blogs / Monetization Ideas

- Tool comparisons (OpenAI vs Claude vs Gemini for classification)
- Tutorials on building AI-based spend dashboards
- Affiliate blogs for invoicing tools or OCR APIs
- Open-source vs paid tool breakdowns

## 🚧 Roadmap

- [ ] Line item extractor module
- [ ] LLM prompt engineering setup
- [ ] Classification evaluation (accuracy vs cost)
- [ ] Streamlit dashboard template
- [ ] Blog content drafts
- [ ] Affiliate links integration
